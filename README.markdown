### UPO The Game

This is a 2D space shooter where you pilot a Mac OS X powered super deadly spaceship.

Your mission, quite simple. Kill all those ugly aliens.

### Background

I wanted to do a video game as my final Project for my degree. Normally you do your project at the last year, but I took that course at my second year because I just couldn't wait more.

It was an awesome experience and I learned a lot. My tutor was Prof. Domingo Savio Rodríguez Baena. http://www.upo.es/eps/rodriguez. I remember his first words 'I am not here to tell you how to program this video game, I don't even know what Pygame is or how does Python syntax looks like. I am here just to give you advise about software development. You are on your on'.                                                             

We went on in an iterative process. Each week we will sit down and ponder what we can do in a couple of days. For example, make the ships collide. And I will do whatever it takes to make that happen. No formal documentation to write, no sense-less state diagrams or any other bullshit. Do you have, at the end of the week, what we agreed? no? what happen?. Yes? that's awesome.

I think that this is the best thing any professor can do. Just let your student discover what he can do. Let curiosity pave the path to its own success.

As a result of this freedom, I taught myself Python, Pygame and Mercurial.
